    "description": "A violation is raised when a variable names departure from the PEP-8 recommendations, i.e., when using capitalized names (except for variables detected to be assigned to a class) or \"camelCased\" naming. Then single character variable names 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) will also raise a violation.",

Naming conventions reported in the official Python style guide known as PEP-8 is recognized as a standard accross the industry and the open source community.",
