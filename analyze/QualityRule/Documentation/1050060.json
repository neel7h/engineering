    "description": "This rule searches for functions that contain a 'break' statement in a 'for' loop. 'break' statements located in nested loops will also be reported as a violation to this rule.\n\nNote: Range-based for loops are not considered because there is no stop condition in the loop definition.",
    "output": "Associated to each Function with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- Number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code:\n  - 'break' statement\n  - 'for' loop",
    "rationale": "A 'for' loop must be straightforward to read. Using too many 'break' statements in 'for' loops makes them more difficult to read.\n    This rule mostly applies to C code where manual clean-up may need to be performed at each step, and having several ways to exit a block can lead to more complex code.",
    "remediation": "Try to remove the 'break' statements from the loop and to manage the end-of-loop within the loop condition part.",
