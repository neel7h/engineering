    "output": "This report lists all artifacts that use raw user input that would expose to file creation vulnerability. \nThis QR provides the following information:\nArtifact Full Name",
    "rationale": "If the file operation attempts to create the file, an attacker can create arbitrary files on the file system or even overwrite existing files. She can use path traversal character sequences (../) to reach any file on the file system. This can be misused to bypass security mechanisms that rely on the presence of a specific file, for example a config or .htaccess file.",
