It is highly recommended to use only one API, especially when you are using a high-level library/framework or wrapping functionalities that provide additional checks on variables.\n\n{@code text} has been introduced in JDK 1.5 and it's equivalent to Equivalent to <code>{@literal}</code>.\n\nDisplays text in code font without interpreting the text as HTML markup or nested Javadoc tags. This enables you to use regular angle brackets (< and >) instead of the HTML entities (&lt; and &gt;) in documentation comments, such as in parameter types (<Object>), inequalities (3 < 4), or arrows (<-). For example, the documentation comment text {@code A<B>C} displayed in the generated HTML page unchanged as A<B>C. This means that the <B> is not interpreted as bold and is in code font. If you want the same functionality without the code font, then use the {@literal} tag.",
