    "description": "Python is a case-sensitive language which allows reutilization of identifier names for different types by simple capitalization changes. A typical example would be using capitalized class names and the corresponding lowercase names for their instances. However defining attributes (methods and fields) in a class that only differ by capitalization can lead to confusion and to unexpected behaviour when used with case-insensitive interfaces.",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
