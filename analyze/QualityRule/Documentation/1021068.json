    "description": "This rule will raise a violation when a variable is explicitly declared as global using the \"global\" keyword. This rule doesn't apply to Python Script objects.",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "Using global variables in short scripts can facilitate the rapid development of effective solutions. Python being originally a scripting language has the \"global\" keyword to declare in a given code block the scope of a variable as global. However use of global variables in OOP is strongly discouraged as it is contrary to encapsulation. Indeed, relying on global state can be a source of unexpected behavior because different elements in a code can freely modify it. Using global variables in Python can also have a negative impact on performance as code involving only local variables runs significantly faster.",
