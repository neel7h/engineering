    "rationale": "The RSA's MD5 hashing algorithm is commonly used in different contexts such as checking data-integrity or simple indexing. However these algorithms should not be used for data encryption. The use of a non security-standard algorithm for hashing a password is dangerous because a determined attacker may be able to break the algorithm with well-known techniques and compromise whatever data has been protected.",
