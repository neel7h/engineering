A typical application will have multiple Activity screens that perform different functions, such as a main Activity screen and a separate settings Activity screen.\n\nA permission that clients must have to launch the activity or otherwise get it to respond to an intent. If a caller of startActivity() or startActivityForResult() has not been granted the specified permission, its intent will not be delivered to the activity.\n\nA violation reported when permission not set for exported Activity and application.",

This may allow a malicious application to gain access to sensitive information, modify the internal state of the application, or trick a user into interacting with the victim application while believing they are still interacting with the malicious application.",
