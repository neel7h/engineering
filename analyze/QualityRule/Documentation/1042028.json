    "description": "Apache Struts versions 2.3 to 2.3.34 and 2.5 to 2.5.16 suffer from possible Remote Code Execution when alwaysSelectFullNamespace is true.\n\nA struts application is vulnerable to this attack only when both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- The alwaysSelectFullNamespace flag is set to true in the Struts configuration. \n- Your application uses actions that are configured without specifying a namespace, or with a wildcard namespace (e.g. \u201c/*\u201d). \n\n\nThis rule will check if both coditions above are fulfilled  in same time. If yes, it gives violation",

If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover.
