    "description": "This metric reports all methods with at least one cath-all except block with an empty implementation. Working with exceptions is common to Python but sometimes using try/except blocks without doing anything when an exception happened is very dangerous.",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "Exceptions are a mechanism to interrupt a program for signaling run-time anomalies in the code. In Python the common way for object type checking is to 'try' methods and properties. Thus well-defined exceptions are expected to appear and often the desired reaction is to silently ignore them.\n        A catch-all except clause (one that captures all types of exceptions) when not properly handled ascribes this behaviour to every exception, included the unexpected. This practice should be avoided because it hinders debugging.",
    "reference": "CISQ OMG ASCRM-RLB-01",
    "remediation": "The exception must be handled correctly according to its type. If no exception type is declared or if a high-level cath-all exception type is used, the body of the exception block should execute specific code or inform if something wrong happened.",
