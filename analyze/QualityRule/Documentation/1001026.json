When computing the Fan-In of an Artifact, multiple accesses to it from the same Artifact are counted as one access. \nThe threshold level is a parameter that can be changed at will.\nSpecial procedures ignored are PT%, ERROR, ERRORMSG, ERRORDB, DEBUG, ERR_DL1 and XERR_DL1. The default parameter value is 10.",
