    "rationale": "Trailing whitespace left in source code is generally inocuous. There is a single exception in Python: if the line continuation backslash marker is followed by an unintentional space and a newline, then it is not interpreted as a line continuation. Besides this syntactic issue, non-meaningful differences in files might get registered because of trailing whitespace addition or removal. It is thus recommended to avoid trailing whitespaces in code.",
