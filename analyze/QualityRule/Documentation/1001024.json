When computing the Fan-Out of an Artifact, multiple accesses to the same component of an Artifact are counted as one access. \nThe threshold is a parameter and can be changed at will.\nPlease note that special procedures ignored in the calculation of this quality rule are PT%, ERROR, ERRORMSG, ERRORDB, DEBUG, ERR_DL1 and XERR_DL1.
