    "description": "This rule will raise a violation when class names departure from the PEP-8 recommendations, i.e., when the recommended use of capitalized \"CamelCased\" naming convention is not used. Exceptions to these rules are found in classes whose instances are expected to be called as functions (i.e. when the \"__call__\" method is defined). Use of acronymns in class naming is also acceptable.",

Naming conventions reported in the official Python style guide known as PEP-8 is recognized as a standard accross the industry and the open source community.",
