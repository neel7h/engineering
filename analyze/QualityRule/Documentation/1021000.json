Cyclomatic Complexity computes the number of the linearly independent paths, a lower bound of all execution paths ignoring multiple iterations.\nChangeability declines with increasing Cyclomatic Complexity.\nComplete testing requires coverage of all execution paths. Cyclomatic Complexity computes the number of the linearly independent paths, a lower bound of all execution paths ignoring multiple iterations.\nTestability declines with increasing Cyclomatic Complexity.",
