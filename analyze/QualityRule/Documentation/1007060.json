Dead Code must be avoided as it makes source code less readable and increases the cost of software maintenance.\n\nWarning:\nUnreferenced code can also be an indication of missing code (code referring to the class not included in the source code analysis) or can be a symptom of the use of polymorphism.\nThe intensive use of polymorphism can make the application easier to change but much more difficult to test, debug and stabilize.",
