    "output": "This report lists  the following information: Function full name, Number of SQL Query Outside Try Block",
    "rationale": "SQL queries can raise exception. If they are not properly catched, the troubleshooting get harder and thus cost is higher.\nThis rule works at the local level. Which means that if the function is called by another function ,and the call is inside a try-on block, it is still a violation because Try-Catch must be implemented at the lowest level of processing to allow fine-grained specialization in exception handling.",
