    "rationale": "String processing is expensive in EGL COBOL Gen for two reasons\n- All text data has to be converted to Unicode\n- EGL has to create/manage strings in its own heap memory manager and garbage collection.   \nDBCHAR is for Double-Byte languages so doubt Halkbank will do this. \nUNICODE should only be used if intentionally trying to do Unicode processing in COBOL Gen as it is a fixed datatype.   If not doing Unicode operations in EGL COBOL Gen, then should use CHAR...Unicode to/from CHAR would require data conversion.",
