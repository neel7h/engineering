    "description": "This vulnerability is categorized as a remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerability because no path name is prefixed to the injection point.",
    "output": "This report lists all artifacts that use file inclusion in improper manner.\nThis QR provides the following information:\nArtifact Full Name",
    "rationale": "An attacker can inject a protocol handler, such as http:// or ftp://, to include remote PHP files and to execute system commands. Further, an attacker is able to include arbitrary files from the file system as PHP code. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive files or to the execution of PHP code that has been placed by the attacker on the file system, for example by injecting a payload into a log file.",
