This vulnerability is combination of two problems:\n\n-Requested action name isn't escaped or checked agains whitelist\n- Double evaluation of an OGNL expression in TextParseUtil.translateVariables when combination of $ and % open chars is used.\n\n\nThis rule with check if wildcard is used for Action mapping name when used version is Struts 2.3.14.2 or older. If yes, it gives a violation",
