    "rationale": "The number of weighted methods in a class is a good indicator of how much time and effort is required to modify and maintain this class. A class with a large number of weighted methods also means that this class has a greater potential impact on derived classes and therefore the cost to maintain and test it is also high.\n\nLarge number of weighted methods also means that this class has a greater potential impact on derived classes.\n\n\nA class with more than 50 weighted methods is considered violation for this QR.",
