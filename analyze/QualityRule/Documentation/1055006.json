    "description": "MD5/SHA1 hashes were used as salt to hash a password or a passphrase. In cryptography, a salt is random data that's used as additional input to a one-way function. Recently, several exploits were developed which proved that MD5 will generate identical outputs for the different input parameters. As a consequence, somebody can break your encryption or log on to your website.",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "The use of a non-standard algorithm is dangerous because a determined attacker may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected. Well-known techniques may exist to break the algorithm.",

    "remediation": "Avoid using MD5 or SHA1 hashes as input to cryptographic functions or to store passwords. Prefer using the following hashing algorithms: SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512.
