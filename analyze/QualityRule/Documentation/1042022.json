    "description": "Application using Apache Struts version 2 (pre-2.3.16) with CookieInterceptor feature are  vulnerable for Injection attack as it was configured to accept all cookies. The risk occurs when \"*\" is used to configure cookiesName param. This allows remote attackers to \"manipulate\" the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code via a crafted request\n\nThis rule will check if wildcard is used to configure cookiesName param for CookieInterceptor when struts version is 2.3.16 or Older. If yes, it gives a violation.",
