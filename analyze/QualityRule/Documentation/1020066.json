    "description": "Each time [\u2026] the Function constructor is called on a string representing source code, the script engine must start the machinery that converts the source code to executable code. This is usually expensive for performance \u2013 easily a hundred times more expensive than a simple function call, for example. \nAn exception will be made for Function('return this')(); . It is the best way to retrieve the global in both node and web with or without \"use strict\".",
