    "rationale": "One of the fundamental OO performance management principles is this: Avoid excessive object creation. This doesn't mean that you should give up the benefits of object-oriented programming by not creating any objects, but you should be wary of object creation inside of tight loops when executing performance-critical code. Object creation is expensive enough that you should avoid unnecessarily creating temporary or intermediate objects in situations where performance is an issue.",
