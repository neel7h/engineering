<!-- *** Defined Types *** -->


<!-- A "XPathValue" is a string value used to specify an XPath query.
-->
<!ENTITY % XPathValue "CDATA">


<!-- A "XPathList" is a list of string values used to specify at least one XPath query.
Items are separated by semicolon. 
-->
<!ENTITY % XPathList "CDATA">


<!-- A "ResolveAs" is a string value used to indicate to JSP Analyzer how a string value should 
be resolved. For "javatype" value, JSP Analyzer will attempt to resolve the string as a Java type 
(class or interface). For the "url" value, JSP Analyzer will attempt to resolve the string as a file 
name or mapping. For "bean" value, JSP Analyzer will attempt to resolve the string as a java bean. 
For "resource" value it will attempt to resolve the string as a file name or mapping and if the 
resolution fails as a Java type and then as a bean. Default value is "url". 
-->
<!ENTITY % ResolveAs "(url|javatype|resource|bean|config-item)">

<!-- A "ResolutionScope" is a string value used to indicate to JSP Analyzer the scope within which a string value should 
be resolved. 
'this' means that the string is to be resolved as a configuration item defined within the referencing item ". 
'parent' means that the string is to be resolved as a configuration item defined within the parent of the referencing item ". 
'file' means that the string is to be resolved as a configuration item defined within the host file of the referencing item ". 
default is 'file'
-->
<!ENTITY % ResolutionScope "(this|parent|file)">


<!-- A "LinkType" is a string value used to specify the type of the link traced between two objects. 
Default value is "call". The value of this attribute it is not case sensitive.
-->
<!ENTITY % LinkType "(access|call|catch|fire|include|inherit|lock
|mention|prototype|raise|refer|relyon|throw|use)">



<!-- *** Document Elements *** -->



<!-- The "xml-config" element is the root of the CAST configuration file
hierarchy, and contains nested elements for all of the other
configuration settings. 
-->
<!ELEMENT xml-config (xref-node*, object-node*, mapping-node*, bean-node*, tiles-cfg-node?, stxx-cfg-node?)>



<!-- The "xref-node" element describes a particular link between the object introduced by its 
parent node ( could be a configuration file object for a "xml-config" element, a mapping object 
for a "mapping-node" element or a bean for a "bean-node" element) and the object resolved using 
the specified XPath query. The following attributes are defined:

xpath      The XPath query used to find a particular node or a list of nodes
           from the associated XML configuration file. 

resolve-as Describes how the JSP Analyzer will resolve the value of each
           node ( JSP File, Java Class, Java Interface or bean).

link-type  Describes the type of the link traced between the object
           introduced by its parent and the resolved object. Default value is 
           "call".

<!ELEMENT xref-node EMPTY>

<!ATTLIST xref-node resolve-as  %ResolveAs;  #IMPLIED  >
<!ATTLIST xref-node link-type   %LinkType;   #IMPLIED  >



<!-- The "object-node" element describes any kind of object. The "xpath"
attribute is used to name the object instance. The following attributes 
are defined:

xpath      The XPath query used to find a particular node or a list of nodes
           from the associated XML configuration file.
value      XPath query used to read the object value node for a particular object node. 

default    The XPath query used to read the mapping "default" node for a 
           particular mapping node. The default value is the empty string (FALSE).
-->
<!ELEMENT object-node (object-node*,xref-node*)>
<!ATTLIST object-node xpath		%XPathValue; #REQUIRED >
<!ATTLIST object-node value		%XPathValue; #REQUIRED >
<!ATTLIST object-node default	%XPathValue; #REQUIRED >



<!-- The "mapping-node" element describes all the elements used to find from the
associated XML configuration file all the mappings that it defines. 
The following attributes are defined:

xpath      The XPath query used to find one or all of the mapping nodes 
           defined in the associated XML configuration file.

key        The XPath query used to read the mapping key node for a particular
           mapping node.

value      A list of XPath queries used to read the mapping key value node for a 
           particular mapping node. The first XPath query which returns a non 
           empty value will be used to set the mapping value. The other ones will
           be ignored (used when the mapping value is introduced by nodes which 
           are mutually exclusive). 

default    The XPath query used to read the mapping "default" node for a 
           particular mapping node. The default value is the empty string (FALSE).

<!ELEMENT mapping-node (xref-node*)>
<!ATTLIST mapping-node xpath   %XPathValue; #REQUIRED >
<!ATTLIST mapping-node key     %XPathValue; #REQUIRED >
<!ATTLIST mapping-node value   %XPathList;  #REQUIRED >
<!ATTLIST mapping-node default %XPathValue; #IMPLIED  >



<!-- The "bean-node" element describes all the elements used to find from the
associated XML configuration file all the java beans that it defines. 
The following attributes are defined:

xpath      The XPath query used to find one or all of the bean nodes 
           defined in the associated XML configuration file.

id         The XPath query used to read the java bean id node for a particular
           bean node.

type       The XPath query used to read the java bean type node for a particular
           bean node. JSP Analyzer will automatically trace a link of type “rely on” 
           between the bean object and the resolved Java type.

scope      The XPath query used to read the java bean scope node for a 
           particular bean node. Default value is the empty string and in this case
           it will be converted to "session" value.
-->

<!-- The "tiles-cfg-node" element describes all the elements used to find from the
associated XML configuration file the path to Tiles configurations files:

xpath      The XPath query used to find one or all of the nodes describing the
           path to Tiles configurations files. 

files      The XPath query used to read the paths of the Tiles configurations files. 
           Note that the value may represent several comma separated file names.

associated XML configuration file the path to STXX transforms configuration file:

xpath      The XPath query used to find the node describing the
           path to STXX transforms configuration file. 

file       The XPath query used to read the paths of the STXX transforms configuration file.
